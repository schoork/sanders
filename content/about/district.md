The Hollandale School District serves about 600 students in grades PreK
(age four) to twelfth grade. The District has two schools, Sanders
Elementary and Simmons Jr/Sr High School, which share the same campus.
Simmons was the original school for African American students until the
district was integrated in the 1960s. It was during this time that the
high school for white children in Hollandale burned down.

The schools and district office are located in Hollandale, MS, a small
town of about 2,700 people. The district is one of four in Washington
County, and it serves Hollandale, Arcola, Darlove, Estell, and several
other small communities in the southeastern part of the county.

Hollandale is a close-knit community with much to be proud of, including
its sports teams, which have won state championships in football,
basketball, and baseball. Most recently, the football team won state
championships in the 1A classification in 2016, 2017, and 2018, winning
over 40 games in a row.

Hollandale is a traditional Delta community in that it was organized
around a small farming community and developed around several
plants which supported those farms. One of these was a catfish processing plant
that developed due to its proximity to Belzoni, MS, which was once the
catfish capital of the world. These plants have since closed, leaving
the community improverished and without major industry. The school
district is now the largest employer in the town, followed by Monsanto,
a seed and chemical company owned by Bayer.

In 2017, Hollandale and its neighboring district to the north, the
[Leland School District](http://lelandschooldistrict.schoolinsites.com/),
were awarded a five-year grant from the
[Promise Neighborhoods Initiative](https://www2.ed.gov/programs/promiseneighborhoods/index.html),
creating the [Deer Creek Promise Community](https://www.facebook.com/deercreekpromisecommunity/).
The grant is administered by the
Delta Health Alliance, and is the second such grant in Mississippi (the first was located in
nearby Sunflower County). Promise Neighborhoods attempt to surround
children with all of the necessary supports to be successful, with
school just being one of those. The Deer Creek Promise Community
provides academic tutors, a community garden, mentors, health case
managers, family counselors, and many other supports for students and
their families.
