T.R. Sanders Elementary School serves about 340 students in grades PreK
(age four) to sixth. Our students come from Hollandale, Arcola, Darlove,
Estell, and several other small communities in Washington County. We are
the only public elementary school serving those communities.

In 2010, due to falling enrollment, the district closed Chambers Middle
School, which is located in Arcola, MS. The sixth grade students then
started attending Sanders, while the seventh and eighth grade students
now attend Simmons Jr/Sr High School.

We share a campus with Simmons, including a cafeteria and several
computer labs. Most of our classrooms are housed in two buildings, Hall
A for PreK through second grade and Hall B for third through sixth grade,
but we also have a separate library, office building, and multipurpose
building that is used for physical education classes and large events.
In 2019 we started a community garden on campus, in collaboration with
[Delta Health Alliance](https://deltahealthalliance.org/),
[Delta Eats](https://www.facebook.com/DeltaEATS/),
and [Food Corps](https://foodcorps.org/).

The school was named after Mr. Theodore Roosevelt Sanders, who served as
the principal of the combined school and superintendent of the district.
His son, Howard Sanders, also served as superintendent of the district.
