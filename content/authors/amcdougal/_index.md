I taught 4th, 5th, and 6th grade ELA and now get to teach 2nd grade. My favorite part of teaching is watching kids make connections between what they are learning, the world they see around them, and themselves. My students are curious and capable, and I love getting to watch them grow into strong, thoughtful leaders.
