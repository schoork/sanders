I grew up all around the Houston, Texas, area. There I earned my B.A. at Rice University studying language and the human brain (Linguistics and Cognitive Sciences), which I get to keep learning about every day as a teacher. I have taught 4th, 5th, and 6th grade ELA and am excited to get to teach 2nd grade. I also enjoy hosting Spanish club and helping students come up with their own projects outside of class. I believe all of life is part of learning about the world, and I continue to learn with my students each day. My favorite things to do are watch mysteries, take road trips, have long discussions, or get outdoors and photograph nature â€” even better if it's by an ocean, river, or waterfall!
