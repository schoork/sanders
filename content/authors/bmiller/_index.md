Originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, I moved to Mississippi in 2019 to teach a magnificent group of first graders who have a passion for learning and growing. Our classroom vision is grounded in respect, service, and community. Through teaching different subjects such as reading, writing, math, social studies, and science, I am constantly aiming to expose my students to the wonders of the world and life outside of these classroom walls. Another goal of mine is to ensure that my students are being taken care of emotionally, mentally, and socially as they grow and develop in their early childhood days.
