I have been in the educational arena for 25 years in Hollandale School District and as a special education teacher for only seven years.  The other years have been as a paraprofessional for six years and the remaining years I worked with infants and toddlers in an early head start setting under the umbrella of Hollandale School District that began in 1999.
