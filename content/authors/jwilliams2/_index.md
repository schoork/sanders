I am 35 years old and a native of Hollandale, Ms. I graduated from Simmons High School in 2002. I graduated from MDCC in 2005 with an AA degree in HPER and a BS degree in 2009 from Delta State University. I love the game of football and been coaching for 16 years at Simmons High. The Hollandale school district has been my employer for the past 10 years as an assistant teacher. Iâ€™m currently working on my certification to become a teacher and one day become a Head Football Coach.
