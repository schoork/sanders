I attended Sanders Elementary School as a student from kindergarten to sixth grade. I was born and raised in Hollandale, MS. Teaching is my passion and I love knowing I can make a positive difference in the lives of others. I am ecstatic about giving back to the community that gave to me, and I'm looking forward to helping each child I encounter unlock their academic potential!
