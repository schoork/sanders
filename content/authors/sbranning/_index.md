I was a stay at home mom until my children were school age. That was the most important thing I EVER did in my life. My children are older now and I have the skills and time to put into other children and teach them good character traits, responsibility and to love God. The same things I did and still do with my own children.

Children at an early age are so receptive and everything is so new to them that they get excited about learning and they want to please you (usually :smile:). Writing this reminds me of why I teach and gets me excited for a NEW year with NEW children that need me, and that I need.
