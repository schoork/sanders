I am a graduate of Delta State University. I am from Leland, MS. I have always wanted to teach because I felt like I would be doing something good for the world by passing down wisdom and knowledge. I am working towards becoming a school counselor so I know how important academic success is for students. I strive to do my very best work with the students, parents/community, and staff to ensure that success is achieved.
