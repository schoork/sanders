I am thrilled to say that this is the start of my 23rd year teaching in the Hollandale School District. I began as a Job Specialist with JMG at Simmons in 1998. I am a native of Hollandlae and graduated with my Bachelor Degree from Jackson State University (97). I obtained both my teacher certification and gifted certification  from Ole Miss (2011, 2019). This year I will continue serving as the gifted education instructor for grades 2-6 and job specialist for JMG for grades 9-12.
