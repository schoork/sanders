This is Sam's fourth year in the Hollandale School District. He started
as the Associate Superintendent of Federal Programs in 2017. In the Fall of
2019, Sam was named the Acting Principal of T.R. Sanders Elementary, and
in the Spring of 2020 became the full-time Principal.

Sam enjoys working with students of all ages and coaching and
supporting teachers in their development. In his spare time, he likes to
build furniture and websites, read science-fiction novels, and take long walks with his dog.
