I am a hardworking individual who pushes my students to work just as hard. I remind them that the sky is not the limit, but only the surface. I am dedicated and devoted to ensuring my students become all that they set their minds too and more. I am teacher, mentor, provider, protector and rewarder. My students are highly motivated and willing to work. I am them and they are me, and together I will assist them into achieving greatness.
