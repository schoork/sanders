Registration is open for the 2020-2021 school year. We are excited to
kick off the year, and we are currently registering students in our
office Monday through Friday from 9am to 4pm.

You can register anyday and you can register all of your Sanders
students at one time. Please make sure you wear a mask, don't have
any COVID-19 symptoms, and haven't been in close contact with someone
who has tested positive for COVID-19.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call us at 827-2024.
