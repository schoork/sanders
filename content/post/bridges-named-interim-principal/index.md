T.R. Sanders Elementary School is excited to announce that Mrs. Shontelle Bridges was named the Interim Principal of the school at a board meeting in October. She was serving as the Curriculum, Instruction, and Assessment Coordinator for the school.

Mrs. Bridges is a native of the Hollandale-Arcola area, is in her thirteenth year with the Hollandale School District, and has two children who attend HSD schools. She has taught every grade from PreK to 5th except for Kindergarten.

"Mrs. Bridges is a fantastic educator," said the former principal, Sam
Williams. "She was an invaluable asset while I was at Sanders; she's
excellent at reading instruction, great with parents and community
members, and truly cares about students. She will do a wonderful job
as the school's principal and instructional leader."

"I am indeed honored and humbled to have this opportunity to lead a
school with awesome students, a supportive community and an extremely
hardworking staff," Mrs. Bridges said.
