The Centers for Disease released [new guidelines for schools](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/Schools-Decision-Tree.pdf?referringSource=articleShare),
restaurants, and other businesses for re-opening to keep workers,
students, and customers safe during the COVID-19 pandemic.

T.R. Sanders Elementary School's staff and administrative team are
working hard to ensure we have instituted these measures to ensure the
safety of staff, students, parents, and the community. We are buying
masks for students and staffs, gloves, disinfectant spray, and
disinfectant spraying machines to ensure our classroom surfaces are as
clean and safe as they can be.
