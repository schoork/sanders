Learning packets can be dropped off in the multipurpose building Wednesday through Friday from 10am to 6pm.

Here are some key points:
- They will be dropped off in crates by homeroom teacher. We will have binder clips or something similar to keep the packets together.
- We will also have devices available for checkout for the summer (ipads for Hall A students and chromebooks for Hall B students).
- And we will have short, small group trainings for how to login to Zoom.
