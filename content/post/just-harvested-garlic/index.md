Ms. Francisco harvested garlic from the garden yesterday. "It needs to
cure for a few weeks", she says, and then "it will be added to
deliveries."

Garlic is a herb that is related to onions, leeks, and chives and is
originally from Siberia. Many people tout garlic's health benefits, but
[the research is mixed](https://www.consumerreports.org/diet-nutrition/the-health-benefits-of-garlic/).

The Food Corps team member has missed working with the students over the
past few months, but she has been tending to the garden and recently
planted sweet potatoes.

Ms. Francisco has also been delivering fresh veggies from
the garden and greenhouse. Recently those deliveries have included
collard greens, kale, rainbow chard, beet greens, and leaf lettuces.
Today she is adding tomatoes and basil to the mix!
