Recently Mississippi was approved to participate in the Pandemic Electronic Benefits Program (P-EBT). This program provides benefits to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and non-SNAP households for children who have temporarily lost access to free or reduced-price school meals due to pandemic-related school closures.

If you are interested, the Mississippi State Department of Health has an
[FAQ Guide](https://www.mdhs.ms.gov/pandemic-ebt-guide/), a help
[email address](mailto:PEBT@mdhs.ms.gov), and a SNAP/TANF support phone
number (800-948-3050).
