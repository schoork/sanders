Gwyn English Nielsen, a New Jersey author, former teacher, and mother,
was scheduled to come read a book to students at Sanders, but then the
Coronavirus hit.

Ms. Nielsen taught English and Communications at Scotch Plains-Fanwood
High School and has written four books. She is donating three of those
books to Sanders Elementary students.

*Torey the Turkey Goes Skiing*, a children's book about love and looking
after one another, will be given to every student who was in Ms. Miller's
1st grade class this past school year. Students who were in Ms.
McDougal's 1st period class (4A) will get a copy of *Serendipity and the
Dream Catcher*, a novella about confronting your fears. Each of these
books was signed by the author.

In addition, Ms. Nielsen has also donated copies of her most recent
book, *From Footlights to Flashlights*, a collection of ten morality
plays, to both the Sanders and Simmons' libraries.

The books will be available for pickup by parents at registration
starting Monday, July 6. They are signed to individual students by name,
so please pick up the correct one.
