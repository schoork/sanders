Dear Students, Parents, and Families of T.R. Sanders Elementary School,

Congratulations on completing another year! Students, you are one year closer to graduation and adulthood. It has been exciting to watch you all grow over the past several months. You should be proud of what you have accomplished and endured in these hard times.

I am sorry that we did not get to have a traditional fourth nine weeks with Sixth Grade and PreK graduation ceremonies. I am sorry that we were not able to honor those students who worked especially hard to make Principal and Superintendent’s List. I am sorry that you did not get to properly say goodbye to your friends and teachers. That must have been hard to miss out on those experiences. We will have these celebrations and ceremonies for the students who missed them, but we will do it when we can ensure that we can have them and keep people safe at the same time.

Because we did not have a traditional fourth nine weeks, and students were graded solely on distance learning packets, we will not be awarding Principal and Superintendent’s List for the fourth nine weeks. When we hold our honors ceremony, we will recognize students who earned spots on these lists for the first three nine weeks of the year.

While we tried to adapt to unexpected closures this Spring, we learned that there is more we can and should do as a school. We need to work harder to ensure ALL students can access the curriculum and make it easier for parents and families to assist their children when school is not in session. We are working on ways to do this and do it better than we have in the past.

The district rill host a distance learning summer school for students with a combination of student work packets and classes through Zoom video conferences. Here are some dates to remember.
- June 3 – 5 - Packet pickup in the bus lane
- June 8 - Summer school starts
- June 29 - 1st 4-weeks packets due
- July 24 - 2nd 4-weeks packets due, end of summer school

As more information about summer school becomes available, we will communicate it through Facebook, our automated calling system, and our new website. If you need an iPad or Chromebook for your child over the summer, please contact their classroom or summer school teacher or by [submitting a concern to me](https://hollandale.schoork.com/parent_concerns/new).

Next year will look different. I’m not sure anyone knows how yet. But as we learn more information and make plans this summer, we will share them with you. We know that communication is one of the most important ways schools can support parents, families, and students in times of crisis. We will continue to use Facebook, our automated calling system, and our new website to communicate vital information as it becomes available. If your phone number changes, please let us know by contacting your child’s teacher or our counselor, Ms. Thomas.

Please stay safe this summer. Remember to wash your hands and try to socially distance with people outside your home. I know it is a hard thing to do, but it will help to keep our loved ones safe. I have loved working with you this year, and I am looking forward to an even better year to come!
