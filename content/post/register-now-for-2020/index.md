The first nine weeks will be virtual, but you still need to register
your child for school. If you don't register your child, they will not
be able to attend virtual classes.

Registration is open daily in the Sanders office
from 9am to 4pm. You can also checkout a laptop or iPad for your child if you don't
already have one.

If you can't make it do to self-quarantine, give us a call and we will
register your child over Zoom or Google Meet.

### Raffle

We will raffle off a $25 gift card to Walmart on the Wednesday and
Friday of this week and next week at the end of the day at 4pm. All
students who are registered by the time of the raffle are eligible to win.

### Here's what you'll need to bring:
- Two proofs of residency, including
  - a photo ID
  - a water, electric, gas, or phone bill
  - voter registration card
- if your student is new to Sanders, will also need
  - a photo ID
  - a birth certificate for your child
  - immunization records

### Please make sure you follow these guidelines for your safety and ours:
- Wear a mask over your mouth and nose
- Leave your kids at home
- Come by yourself
- Stay at home if your temperature is 100.4 or higher
