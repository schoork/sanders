Ms. LahQiana Fain is joining Sanders as an upper elementary math
teacher. She is a graduate of Delta State University, a native of Hollandale,
and currently has a son in the school.

Ms. Fain wants to give back to her community and eventually become a principal.
She will work hard to engage with parents, especially in helping them become
more familiar with technology.

Ms. Rachel Thompson is a graduate of Agnes Scott College and a member of
Teach for America. She is originally from Oregon. Ms. Thompson will also
be an upper elementary math teacher.

Organized and full of energy, Ms. Thompson was drawn to teaching with a
sense of purpose and service. She gets along well with others and will
bring a lot of positive vibes to Sanders Elementary.
