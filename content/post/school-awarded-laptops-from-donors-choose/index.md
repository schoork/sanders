The school was recently awarded four chromebooks from a
[Donors Choose](https://www.donorschoose.org/) grant written by Ms.
Abigail McDougal. The laptops will be checked out to students in the
upper elementary this summer so they can continue learning from home
and practice their typing skills.

Ms. McDougal has been working on several grants for the school,
including this one. She is hoping to increase students' access to
technology during the pandemic and school closures so that learning
doesn't stop even though they have to be at home.
