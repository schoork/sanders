Summer school packets can be picked up at the following times this week.
Pickup is in Building C. We encourage you to wear a mask and practice
social distancing.

Day|Times
---|---
Wednesday, June 3|9:30am - 1:30pm
Thursday, June 4|1:30pm - 5:30pm
Friday, June 5|9:30am - 1:30pm

A hotline has been setup for summer school queries. If you have questions about summer school, call [(662) 314-3738](tel:662-314-3738) from 8:30am to 1:00pm, Monday through Friday.

When the schedule has been posted for classes, which start next week, we
will post them here, on our website.

*Correction: The original post stated that pickup of packets was in the
bus lane. It has been moved inside due to the heat.*
