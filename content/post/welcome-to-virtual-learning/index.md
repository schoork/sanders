**UPDATE 8/6/20** Click on the teacher's name at the bottom of this post
to directly access their video classes via Zoom.

## Quick Details
- What: The 2020-2021 School Year
- When: Wednesday, August 5, 2020
- Where: Virtually
- Who: All Registered Students in grades PreK - 6th

**Only students who are registered can attend virtual classes and
complete work.**

## How do I access the work?

This school year will start virtually for Sanders' students. For those that can get online, we have a list of links below to access class times and work. For those who can't, we will have individually made packets available for pick-up starting on Wednesday at 8:00 am*.

Students have a five-hour day that starts earlier for grades PreK - 2nd and later for grades 3rd - 6th. See the table below for links, times, and anything else you might need.

*_These packets will be ready on Mondays, starting August 10. The district's weekly feeding program will also run on Mondays._

## Can my student attend classes in person?

Unfortunately, no. Mississippi currently has a 22% positive test rate, the highest in the country, and some experts expect it to have the worst infection rate per capita by the end of the pandemic.

While we strive to keep teachers, students, and families safe, we understand that this makes it harder for parents and students. Our teachers are hurting, too. They miss your children and want desperately to teach them in person.

Please remember that the decision to go virtual, although I, Sam Williams, agree with it, was not made by your child's teacher. They will do their best over these first nine weeks to educate your child and help them grow.

## How will I know who my child's teacher is?

Teachers are starting to reach out to their students and parents this
week via phone. You can also see your child's teacher via
[ActiveParent](https://ms7611.activeparent.net/Login.aspx). And if you
don't receive a call or can't access ActiveParent, feel free to give us
a call.

## How is attendance calculated?

According to new guidelines published by MDE, students must work every day for four hours. We use a combination of video classes, tutorial sessions, interventions, and independent work, as we would during a typical, in-person school day.

Students who attend virtual sessions and complete their work are presentâ€”students who don't are absent, based on MDE guidelines.

## How can I get a Chromebook for my child?

We have currently run out of Chromebooks, but we have ordered some, and they are on their way. Let your child's teacher know you would like for them to have a Chromebook, and when they come in and are ready, we will let you know.

## How can I get a hot spot (wifi device) for my child?

Contact your child's teacher and let them know you need one. We will work on getting you one.

## How are grades calculated?

Students will still receive one major and two minor grades per week in their classes. Students who can't get online will need to talk to their teacher daily and then turn their work in each week on Mondays.
