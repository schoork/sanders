Zoom is currently experiencing and dealing with
[outages accross the country](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/24/us/zoom-outage-worldwide-trnd/index.html).
We, at Sanders Elementary School, are working as
hard as we can to get our teachers and students back online.

In the meantime, if students can't access their online classes, they
should work on their independent assignments.

We apologize for any issues and problems this causes.
